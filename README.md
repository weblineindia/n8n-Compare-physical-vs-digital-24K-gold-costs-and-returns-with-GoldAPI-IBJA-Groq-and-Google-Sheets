# Gold Investment Intelligence: Physical vs. Digital 24K Cost & Return Analysis

This high-performance n8n workflow automates the complex task of comparing gold investment types in the Indian market. By pulling live data from the **GoldAPI** (Digital) and the **IBJA** (Physical benchmark), it calculates the "Landed Cost" including GST and making charges to provide a data-driven "Buy/Wait" verdict powered by a **Groq-hosted LLM**.

Stop manually calculating gold spreads across different platforms. This workflow fetches real-time 24K gold rates, applies localized taxes (3% GST) and industry-standard fees (3-8%), analyzes global market sentiment via Yahoo Finance RSS and logs a professional investment report to Google Sheets. It transforms raw data into an actionable "Efficiency Score" using AI.

### Quick Implementation Steps

1. **Import** the JSON file into your n8n canvas.
2. **Get API Key:** Sign up at [GoldAPI.io](http://GoldAPI.io) and paste your token into the **Get Digital Price** header.
3. **Connect AI:** Add your Groq API credentials to the **Groq Chat Model** node.
4. **Prepare Sheet:** Create a Google Sheet with these headers: `Date`, `Digital_Price`, `Physical_Price`, `Arbitrage`, `Sentiment` and `Efficiency_Score`.
5. **Authorize:** Link your Google account in the **Add Report** node and select your spreadsheet.

# What It Does

This workflow acts as a 24/7 Quantitative Financial Analyst specialized in the gold market. It eliminates the "hidden cost" surprise by calculating the absolute final price an investor pays out-of-pocket for 1 gram of 24K gold. It doesn't just look at the ticker price; it factors in the 3% GST applicable in India, platform spreads for digital gold apps and making charges for physical coins/bars.

Beyond raw arithmetic, the workflow contextually understands the global landscape. By scraping the latest commodity headlines from Yahoo Finance, the integrated AI Agent determines if the current market vibe is **Greedy**, **Neutral** or **Fearful**. It then synthesizes the price gap and the news into a single **Efficiency Score** (1-100), telling you exactly how favorable the buying conditions are today.

Finally, it maintains a permanent investment ledger. Every execution logs the data into a Google Sheet and formats a clean report ready to be sent to messaging apps, ensuring you never miss a buying opportunity when the **Arbitrage** (the price difference) favors one medium over the other.

## Requirements

To use this workflow, you need:

- [**n8n account (Self-hosted or Cloud)**](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).
- **GoldAPI Token:** Free or Paid API key from GoldAPI.io.
- **Groq API Key:** To power the AI analysis (supports Llama 3 or Mixtral models).
- **Google Account:** For logging data into Google Sheets.
- **Internet Access:** To scrape the IBJA (India Bullion and Jewellers Association) website.

## How It Works & Set Up

### Step 1: Data Collection

The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** (can be changed to a **Schedule Trigger** for daily runs). It fetches the live 1-gram digital gold price in INR via an HTTP Request to GoldAPI. Simultaneously, it scrapes the official IBJA website to extract the physical benchmark rate using the CSS selector `#GoldRatesCompare999`.

### Step 2: The Math (Landed Costs)

The **Comparator** node uses JavaScript to apply real-world fees:

- **Digital:** Adds 3% GST and a 3% platform spread.
- **Physical:** Adds 3% GST and 8% making charges (standard for coins).
- It then determines which is cheaper and calculates the exact difference.

### Step 3: Market Context

The workflow pulls the top 3 most recent gold market headlines from Yahoo Finance. These are bundled together so the AI can read them in one go.

### Step 4: AI Analysis & Output

The **AI Agent** takes the math and the news headlines. It outputs a structured JSON verdict containing:

- **Arbitrage Check:** A one-sentence summary of the best deal.
- **Sentiment:** A label (Greedy/Neutral/Fearful).
- **Efficiency Score:** A rating out of 100.

### Step 5: Logging

The data is formatted into a readable message and appended as a new row in your designated Google Sheet.

## How To Customize Nodes

- **Adjust Fees:** If your local jeweler charges 10% instead of 8%, simply open the **Comparator** node and change the `1.08` value in the code.
- **Change AI Model:** In the **Groq Chat Model** node, you can switch between different models (e.g., Llama-3-70b vs 8b) depending on your speed and accuracy needs.
- **Update Selectors:** If the IBJA website updates its design, you can update the CSS Selector in the **Extract Physical Price** node to point to the new data location.

## Add-ons

- **WhatsApp/Telegram Notifications:** Add a node after "Message Format" to send the daily report directly to your phone.
- **Email Summary:** Use the Gmail or Outlook node to send a weekly summary of the best buying days to your inbox.
- **Price Drop Alert:** Add an **IF Node** to only trigger the workflow if the gold price drops by more than 2% in a single day.

## Use Case Examples

- **Automated Savings:** Set the workflow to run every morning at 10 AM to decide where to put your daily savings.
- **Jewelry Business Tool:** Use the data to show customers that your physical prices are competitive compared to digital market apps.
- **Market Research:** Use the Google Sheet history to track how "Sentiment" affects the price of gold over several months.
- **Arbitrage Trading:** Identify moments when digital gold is significantly undervalued compared to physical benchmarks.
- **Wealth Management:** Proactively notify clients when the "Efficiency Score" hits 90+, indicating a prime buying opportunity.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Digital Price = 0 or Error** | API Key is missing or expired. | Check the "Get Digital Price" node; ensure the token is in the headers. |
| **Physical Price Extraction Fails** | Website structure changed. | Verify the URL and the CSS selector `#GoldRatesCompare999` on IBJA. |
| **AI Agent gives generic response** | Prompt is too vague or news is missing. | Ensure the "Data Array" node is successfully bundling headlines. |
| **Google Sheets won't append** | Missing columns or incorrect ID. | Ensure headers (`Date`, `Sentiment`, etc.) match exactly in your sheet. |
